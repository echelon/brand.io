Brandon's Homepage
==================
[![](http://i.imgur.com/553NfvLm.png)](http://brand.io)

This is the content of my homepage, **[brand.io](http://brand.io)**.

I wrote this over a year ago. There's much I've learned, leaving even more left to fix about this webpage.

**TODO:**
* Build script and process ***SUCKS***.
* Directory structure is pretty terrible.
* Javascript isn't AMD, versioned, or reusable. 
* Why JSON? Just put it all in Python if you're gonna use it at all.

The design and look/feel are _not open source_, but you may use the build scripts, HTML, etc (not that they're any good) under the MIT. Also, the DNA (well, RNA) isn't open source, but you're more than welcome to learn Three.js from it.

In short, please don't rip off my design and claim it as your own (again, not that it's any good), but take what you need otherwise.
